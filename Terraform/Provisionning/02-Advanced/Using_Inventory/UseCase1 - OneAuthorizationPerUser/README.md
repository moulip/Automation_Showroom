Instructions for using inventory variables in Terraform

1.	Define Inventory Variables
All inventory variables are set in the file: data_input/inventory.yml

2. Ensure Proper Formatting
The inventory.yml file must follow a valid YAML structure.

3. Declare the Inventory File in the Root Module
In the root moduleâ€™s main.tf, the inventory file is declared as a local variable using yamldecode.

4. Access the Variables
Use local.<key> to call the variables in your Terraform files.
